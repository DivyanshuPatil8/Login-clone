# Login-clone
it is clone I created a clean and responsive login page clone using HTML and CSS. The design closely mimics real-world login interfaces, focusing on simplicity, usability, and visual appeal. This project helped me strengthen my frontend layout and styling skills, and it's a great example of building a functional, professional-looking UI without using any external frameworks.
